## Command History 

```bash
npm i axios bcryptjs jsonwebtoken nodemailer react-hot-toast mongoose
```

No need to add express in Nextjs (has built-in express alternatives), would be using jwt and nodemailer services as well as mongoose for the ORM to communicate with db, react-hot-toast for popup notification stuff.
